# TeamCloud

TeamCloud is a tool that enables enterprise IT organizations to provide application development teams "self-serve" access to secure compliant cloud development environments.

## About

**This project is in active development and will change.**  As the tool becomes ready for use, it will be [versioned](https://semver.org/) and released.

We will do our best to conduct all development openly by [documenting](https://github.com/microsoft/TeamCloud/tree/master/docs) features and requirements, and managing the project using [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/TeamCloud/issues), [milestones](https://github.com/microsoft/TeamCloud/milestones), and [projects](https://github.com/microsoft/TeamCloud/projects).
