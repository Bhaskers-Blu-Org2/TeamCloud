# Backlog

This document contains an initial list of possible features and enhancements that will **not** be included in the initial version of TeamCloud, but may be considered for future releases.

_Note: This is meant to be a working list during the initial design phase of TeamCloud.  These features are in no particular order, assumptions driving each feature have not been validated, and inclusion in this list does not guarantee the feature will be included in a future TeamCloud release.  In the future, the items in this list will be replaced with [issues](https://github.com/microsoft/TeamCloud/issues), and this document will be removed._

## Shared Storage

Create a storage account and implement an interface for Providers to access it to save state, etc.

## Shared Key Vault

Create a Key Vault instance and implement an interface for Providers to access it to save secrets.
